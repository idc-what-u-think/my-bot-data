This is a *major* vulnerability for vote integrity.)\n\n3.  **Voting Results (1 hour):**\n    *   Girl: +500-600 votes (50-60% of her follower count)\n    *   Guy: +300 votes (approx. 0.014% of his follower count)\n\n**Factor: When people will be online**\n*   If this happened during peak engagement hours (e.g., evening for most audiences), the girl's numbers are even more suspicious, as that level of *organic* engagement is almost impossible for a real audience on a simple poll.\n*   If it was off-peak, it makes the girl's numbers even more glaringly manipulated.\n\n**Factor: Amounts of multiple entry**\n*   This is the **primary factor**. Given the Google Docs platform:\n    *   **Girl's Votes:** A 50-60% \"vote rate\" from 1k followers in a single hour is extremely unnatural for organic reach, even for highly engaged micro-influencers. It strongly suggests multiple entries from a smaller group of individuals, or even automated/bot activity exploiting the Google Docs vulnerability. A few dedicated people spamming the form could easily generate those numbers.\n    *   **Guy's Votes:** While 300 votes from 2.1M followers is a very low engagement rate (0.014%), it's more plausible as *actual* individual votes from a small segment of a massive, potentially less focused audience. His audience might not be as motivated for this specific poll, or he hasn't promoted it effectively, or his audience is simply too vast and diverse for a high *percentage* to vote on a niche Google Doc.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe data heavily suggests that the **girl's votes are likely inflated due to multiple entries**, taking advantage of the Google Docs platform's lack of built-in vote security. Her engagement percentage is unrealistically high for organic, unique votes. The guy's votes, while numerically lower, are more likely to represent a genuine (albeit small) segment of unique voters from his larger audience, or at least aren't showing the same clear signs of manipulation."
