The operating system (like Android or iOS) isolates applications, preventing them from directly accessing or scanning other apps' memory or core system files without explicit permissions.\n\nWithin their sandbox, games employ various anti-cheat mechanisms to monitor their own process for unauthorized modifications:\n\n1.  **Checksums and Hashing:** They periodically calculate checksums or cryptographic hashes of critical code segments and data structures. If a hacker modifies these areas (e.g., to alter game logic or bypass checks), the calculated hash will no longer match the expected value, signaling a tamper.\n2.  **Value Monitoring:** Anti-cheat systems continuously scan for unusual or impossible values in key in-game variables like health, currency, or cooldown timers. If a player's health jumps to an absurdly high number or a cooldown instantaneously resets, it's flagged as a potential memory edit.\n3.  **Code Integrity Checks:** They look for injected code, modified instructions, or altered function pointers within their own process space. This can involve scanning memory regions for executable code that doesn't belong to the original application.\n4.  **Behavioral Analysis:** While not strictly memory scanning, anti-cheat also analyzes player actions and game state for patterns indicative of cheating (e.g., impossibly fast movement, perfect aim, or exploiting glitches that arise from memory manipulation).\n5.  **Obfuscation and Encryption:** Game data and code are often obfuscated or encrypted in memory. Anti-cheat checks for attempts to decrypt or de-obfuscate these elements without authorization.\n\nBy focusing on their own process's memory space, games can effectively detect many common memory-based cheating methods without needing \"direct access to the phone\" beyond their designated application sandbox."
