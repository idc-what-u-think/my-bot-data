This law describes an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion.\n\n2.  **Newton's Third Law of Motion:**\n    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force on object A that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects."

If such a force, however supernatural its origin, is applied to redirect the bullet, the bullet would then follow the path dictated by this new force, much like a physical obstacle or an electromagnetic field might alter a projectile's course. Its original momentum would be overcome by the new, opposing, or redirecting force."
