This law describes an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion.\n\n2.  **Newton's Third Law of Motion:**\n    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force on object A that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects."

If such a force, however supernatural its origin, is applied to redirect the bullet, the bullet would then follow the path dictated by this new force, much like a physical obstacle or an electromagnetic field might alter a projectile's course. Its original momentum would be overcome by the new, opposing, or redirecting force."

In this scenario, the \"spiritual force\" or \"superpower\" acts as that external force. As long as this force is actively applied and successfully alters the bullet's momentum, the bullet will deviate from its original path and follow the new trajectory dictated by the applied force. The original force that propelled the bullet forward is still present, but the new, perpendicular, or opposing force changes the net force acting on the bullet, resulting in a change of direction."
