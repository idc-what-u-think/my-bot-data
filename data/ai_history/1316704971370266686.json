          "text": "You're likely referring to **margin of error**.\n\nThe **margin of error** is a statistic that quantifies the amount of random sampling error in a survey's results. It indicates how many percentage points the results from a sample might differ from the true population value.\n\nEssentially, it creates a range (a confidence interval) around the estimate from your sample, within which the true population parameter is expected to fall with a certain level of confidence (e.g., a \"plus or minus 3 percentage points\" margin of error at a 95% confidence level means if you conducted the survey many times, 95% of the time the true population value would be within that range).\n\nIt is influenced by three main factors:\n1.  **Sample size:** Larger samples generally lead to a smaller margin of error.\n2.  **Variability (standard deviation):** Greater variability in the data results in a larger margin of error.\n3.  **Confidence level:** A higher confidence level (e.g., 99% vs. 95%) will increase the margin of error."

          "text": "Yes, **margin of error** (often colloquially referred to as \"marginal error\") is a very strong candidate for the answer to this riddle.\n\nHere's why:\n\n*   **\"I am a child of truth and lies\"**: It represents the potential deviation of an estimate (a \"lie\" in the sense of not being the exact truth) from the true population value (\"truth\").\n*   **\"Born from agreement yet I fade with certainty\"**: It's calculated based on statistical methods and agreed-upon confidence levels. However, as certainty increases (e.g., through larger sample sizes or if you knew the entire population), the margin of error shrinks and eventually fades to zero.\n*   **\"The more you seek me, the less you find me\"**: Scientists actively work to *reduce* the margin of error by taking larger samples and improving research methods. The more precisely they try to measure, the smaller this \"error\" becomes.\n*   **\"Scientists chase me, but never catch me\"**: In most practical research using samples, a margin of error will always exist; it can be minimized but rarely eliminated entirely without surveying the entire population."

These would include categories such as:\n\n*   **Statistical/Measurement Concepts:** e.g., margin of error, uncertainty, bias, random error, approximation.\n*   **Epistemological/Philosophical Concepts:** e.g., doubt, ignorance, the unknown, a hypothesis, the pursuit of absolute truth.\n*   **Abstract/Figurative Concepts:** e.g., perfection, subjectivity, wisdom.\n\nWhile a \"full web search\" might yield many more *suggestions*, many would be duplicates, highly speculative, or clearly not fit the clues. This count represents distinct, plausible interpretations that could be reasonably argued."
