For clarity, these phrases are drawn from **Hawaiian Pidgin (Hawaii Creole English)**, a vibrant and widely spoken creole in Hawaii.\n\nHere are five medium-difficulty phrases for him to translate:\n\n1.  **\"You stay good?\"**\n2.  **\"Whea da kine, brah?\"**\n3.  **\"Gotta go grind sum kine.\"**\n4.  **\"Eh, no make li'dat!\"**\n5.  **\"She stay talk story wit' her ohana.\"**\n\nGood luck to Barry! Let me know if he needs any hints."
