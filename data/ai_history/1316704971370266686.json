          "text": "If someone froze time and used telekinesis to change the bullet's direction before resuming time, the bullet would travel in the **new direction it was oriented towards**, provided the telekinetic force also imparted a new velocity to it.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Frozen Time:** When time is frozen, the bullet's motion completely ceases. It effectively becomes a stationary object. Its original momentum is zeroed out during this state.\n2.  **Telekinesis:** While time is frozen, telekinesis could easily reorient the stationary bullet to face any desired direction.\n3.  **Resuming Time:** For the bullet to then *move* in this new direction upon time resuming, the telekinetic ability would need to do more than just change its orientation. It would have to **impart a new velocity (propulsive force)** to the bullet in the chosen direction, effectively acting as a new \"shot.\" If it only reoriented the bullet without giving it new forward momentum, the bullet would simply remain stationary in its new orientation (or fall due to gravity if unsupported).\n\nTherefore, for the scenario to result in the bullet \"going to the direction it was turned to,\" the telekinetic power must encompass both reorientation and the application of a new propulsive force."
