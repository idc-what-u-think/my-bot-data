          "text": "You're likely referring to **margin of error**.\n\nThe **margin of error** is a statistic that quantifies the amount of random sampling error in a survey's results. It indicates how many percentage points the results from a sample might differ from the true population value.\n\nEssentially, it creates a range (a confidence interval) around the estimate from your sample, within which the true population parameter is expected to fall with a certain level of confidence (e.g., a \"plus or minus 3 percentage points\" margin of error at a 95% confidence level means if you conducted the survey many times, 95% of the time the true population value would be within that range).\n\nIt is influenced by three main factors:\n1.  **Sample size:** Larger samples generally lead to a smaller margin of error.\n2.  **Variability (standard deviation):** Greater variability in the data results in a larger margin of error.\n3.  **Confidence level:** A higher confidence level (e.g., 99% vs. 95%) will increase the margin of error."
