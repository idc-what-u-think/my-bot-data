It allows players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world. Key features include:\n\n*   **Building and Crafting:** Players gather resources to craft tools, items, and build structures.\n*   **Exploration:** Vast, infinite worlds with diverse biomes, caves, and structures to discover.\n*   **Survival and Adventure:** Players can face hostile mobs, mine for rare resources, and even defeat a final boss.\n*   **Creativity:** A highly open-ended experience that encourages player ingenuity.\n\nReleased in 2011, Minecraft is recognized as the best-selling video game of all time, with over 300 million copies sold across various platforms as of late 2023 [1].\n\n***\n[1] Microsoft.
