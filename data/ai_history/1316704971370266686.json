This law describes an object's resistance to changes in its state of motion.\n\n2.  **Newton's Third Law of Motion:**\n    For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that if object A exerts a force on object B, then object B simultaneously exerts a force on object A that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction. These forces act on different objects."
