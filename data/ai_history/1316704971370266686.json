That's super clutch. ðŸ’¯\n\nYou could def include:\n*   **Command handler templates:** Basic `!ping` or `!help` structures\n*   **Embed builders:** So ppl can make fancy messages quick âœ¨\n*   **Utility functions:** Like random numbers, time formatting, string manipulation\n*   **API fetch patterns:** For getting data from external sites (jokes, weather, etc.)\n*   **Config variable examples:** How to safely store tokens, prefixes, etc.\n\nThat'd save everyone so much time, fr!
