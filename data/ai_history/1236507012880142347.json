It's not really a \"just code\" kinda thing for Python from scratch.\n\nBut hey, we can totally start small! Like, a lil 2D shooter with Pygame? That's how ppl usually kick off game dev. Whatcha think?"

Think of it as your game's stage:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n\n# Initialize Pygame\npygame.init()\n\n# Set up the screen (width, height)\nscreen_width = 800\nscreen_height = 600\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))\npygame.display.set_caption(\"My Awesome 2D Shooter\") # Window title, lol\n\n# Game loop\nrunning = True\nwhile running:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            running = False\n\n    # (Your game drawing code will go here later)\n    # Fill the screen with black (or any color, RGB)\n    screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n\n    # Update the display\n    pygame.display.flip()\n\n# Quit Pygame\npygame.quit()\nprint(\"Game Over, thanks for playing!\")\n```\n\nJust run that, and you'll get a black window! üî• What kinda thing you wanna add first? Like, a player character? Or maybe some enemies? Lmk!"

How about we start with a character that actually MOVES and maybe even shoots, instead of just chillin'? That's already more than a static COD character, amirite? üòâ\n\nHere's how you'd get a lil rectangle moving around with WASD or arrow keys:\n\n```python\nimport pygame\n\npygame.init()\n\nscreen_width = 800\nscreen_height = 600\nscreen = pygame.display.set_mode((screen_width, screen_height))\npygame.display.set_caption(\"My Awesome 2D Shooter\")\n\n# --- Player Stuff ---\nplayer_size = 50\nplayer_x = (screen_width / 2) - (player_size / 2) # Center horizontally\nplayer_y = screen_height - player_size - 10       # Near bottom\nplayer_speed = 5 # How fast your dude moves\nplayer_color = (0, 255, 0) # Green, obvs\n\n# Game loop\nrunning = True\nwhile running:\n    for event in pygame.event.get():\n        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n            running = False\n\n    # --- Player Movement Input ---\n    keys = pygame.key.get_pressed() # Checks all pressed keys\n    if keys[pygame.K_LEFT] or keys[pygame.K_a]:\n        player_x -= player_speed\n    if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT] or keys[pygame.K_d]:\n        player_x += player_speed\n    if keys[pygame.K_UP] or keys[pygame.K_w]:\n        player_y -= player_speed\n    if keys[pygame.K_DOWN] or keys[pygame.K_s]:\n        player_y += player_speed\n\n    # Keep player on screen (basic boundaries)\n    if player_x < 0:\n        player_x = 0\n    if player_x > screen_width - player_size:\n        player_x = screen_width - player_size\n    if player_y < 0:\n        player_y = 0\n    if player_y > screen_height - player_size:\n        player_y = screen_height - player_size\n\n\n    screen.fill((0, 0, 0)) # Clear screen each frame\n\n    # --- Draw Player ---\n    pygame.draw.rect(screen, player_color, (player_x, player_y, player_size, player_size))\n\n    pygame.display.flip()\n\npygame.quit()\nprint(\"Game Over, thanks for playing!\")\n```\n\nNow you got a green square that zooms around! üéÆ Whatcha wanna add next to make it even more \"advanced\"? Like, a health bar? Or a *real* sprite image instead of a square? Lmk!"
