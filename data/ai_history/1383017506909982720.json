Cut to 5 mins later, I drop the entire cutting board, onions EVERYWHERE. My cat, Mittens, just sits there, judging me from the counter. Her face was like, \"bruh.\" 💀\n\nI just ordered pizza. GG. 😂"

For like, 30 mins straight. I'm just sitting there, staring at a buffering circle, feeling my soul leave my body. 👻 Had to restart the router like five times. The struggle was real. 😩\n\nEventually worked, but my whole chill vibe was gone. Rip. 😂"
