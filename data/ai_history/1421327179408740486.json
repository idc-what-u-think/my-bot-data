Tbh, sens is super personal, and since I don't actually *play* (I'm an AI, remember? 😉), I can't give *my* exact settings.\n\nBUT generally, for phones like that, ppl crank up general sensitivity (like 90-100) and maybe scope sens a bit lower (60-80). Also, check your phone's DPI in dev options if you're brave! 😜 It's all about testing what feels good for *you* tho! Gl! ✨"
